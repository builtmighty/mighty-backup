= 2.14.0 =
**Bundled audit fixes — six independent PRs landing in one release. Focused entirely on the Codespace-producer scope; no new operational surface.**

* **(PR1) No-PK large-table handling — Hybrid B→D degradation chain.** Before: a big table without a single-column numeric `PRIMARY KEY` got its data SKIPPED entirely in the chunked-mysqldump path (only the `CREATE TABLE` survived) — WooCommerce extension tables and audit/log tables shipped empty in the Codespace bootstrap snapshot. Now `Mighty_Backup_Database_Exporter::get_table_cursor_column()` walks `PRIMARY KEY → single-column UNIQUE NOT NULL → auto_increment` and feeds the existing range pipeline; numeric cursors compute the next range bound arithmetically, non-numeric cursors use `next_cursor_upper_bound()`'s indexed `LIMIT-N` seek. When no cursor exists at all, `dump_table_full_via_mysqldump()` runs one mysqldump invocation for that table in its own Action Scheduler chunk with `set_time_limit(0)`. The PHP-path `export_table_data_offset()` fallback now wraps its loop in `REPEATABLE READ + START TRANSACTION WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT` on InnoDB so concurrent writes can't shift rows across pages.
* **(PR2) State-machine race cluster.** Four compounding reliability bugs resolved: (a) TOCTOU in `schedule()` is now atomic via `add_site_option()` as a CAS primitive — concurrent triggers from wp-cron + admin "Run Now" + WP-CLI get a single winner instead of stomped state. (b) `is_running()` now returns true for `pending` AND `cancelling` statuses, closing multi-second race windows. (c) `cancel()` writes a `cancelling` tombstone BEFORE deleting actions; `fail()` re-reads state at entry and skips the resurrecting save when it sees the tombstone. (d) `step_start` / `step_export_db` / `step_archive_files` / `step_upload_db` / `step_upload_files` / `step_cleanup` all early-exit when their result-signal key is already set, preventing duplicate multi-GB Spaces uploads on Action Scheduler re-fires after a worker SIGKILL.
* **(PR3) Scheduler correctness.** Three direct hits to the stated purpose: (a) registered the `weekly` recurrence via the `cron_schedules` filter — WordPress core only ships `hourly`/`twicedaily`/`daily`, and without this filter `wp_schedule_event('weekly', ...)` silently returned false, so an operator who chose Weekly got ZERO backups. (b) `calculate_next_run()` now honors `schedule_day` for the weekly recurrence — the setting was stored but ignored. (c) Replaced the WP-5.3-deprecated `current_time('timestamp')` + `strtotime()` combo with `wp_timezone()` + `DateTimeImmutable`, fixing the DST-day drift where the next fire could shift by an hour twice a year.
* **(PR4) DigitalOcean Spaces multipart-upload lifecycle.** Cancelling a backup mid-upload, or any final-attempt `MultipartUploadException`, used to leave the already-uploaded parts on Spaces — for a 20 GB archive at 5 MB parts that's ~4,000 orphan parts per cancel, billed indefinitely. Three-layer defense: `Spaces_Client::upload()` now calls `abortMultipartUpload` via the `MultipartUploadException`'s state when the final retry fails; `ensure_lifecycle_policy()` idempotently installs an `AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload` rule (Days: 1) under the `client_path/` prefix on plugin activation; `sweep_orphan_multiparts()` lists multiparts older than 24h via `ListMultipartUploads` and aborts them, wired into the daily retention cron.
* **(PR5) Retention correctness + state-shape hardening.** Three small fixes bundled: (a) `Retention_Manager::prune_prefix()` now sorts by the backup-`{Y-m-d-His}` key prefix (lexicographically monotonic) instead of trusting Spaces' `LastModified` (which isn't globally monotonic under clock skew), and refuses to delete anything `LastModified < 1h` ago. Zero-objects-under-prefix now emits a "verify client_path setting" warning since the common cause is a rename orphaning the old prefix. (b) `Mighty_Backup_Manager::validate_db_export_shape()` is called from the top of `step_export_db` — catches a `db_export` sub-state in the wrong shape (e.g., a backup in flight at upgrade time) and fails with a clear message instead of dereferencing missing keys deep in the run loop. (c) `process_next_action()` now catches `\Throwable` (was `\Exception`) so a `TypeError` inside an action can't skip `release_claim()` and wedge the Action Scheduler claim globally for every AS user on the install.
* **(PR6) State-bloat + history retention polish.** Three quality-of-life fixes: (a) `save_state()` writes `STATE_OPTION` with `autoload=no` on first creation on single-site installs, so the 50–100 KB serialized backup state isn't loaded on every wp-admin page hit. Multisite is unaffected (uses `wp_sitemeta` which has no autoload concept). (b) `Mighty_Backup_Logger::prune_history()` deletes history rows older than 90 days (filterable via `mighty_backup_history_retention_days`); wired into the daily retention cron. (c) The retention cron also sweeps stale `completed` STATE_OPTION rows older than 72h — the post-backup state currently lingers until the next `schedule()` call clears it, so an install that runs a backup once and stops would carry the stale option forever.

= 2.13.2 =
* Fixed `count(): Argument #1 ($value) must be of type Countable|array, null given` fatal in `Mighty_Backup_Manager::get_status()` on PHP 8 when polling status during a chunked-mysqldump database export (regression introduced in 2.13.0). The chunked path's `$state['db_export']` shape uses `big_tables` / `big_tables_index` keys, but `get_status()` was still reading the PHP path's `tables` / `tables_exported` keys, fataling on the absent `tables` key. Now branches on `db_export['method']` and guards both shapes with `?? null` + `is_array()` so a malformed state can never re-introduce the fatal. Affected callers: `wp mighty-backup status`, the admin-UI AJAX polling, and the WP-CLI poll loop in `wp mighty-backup run`.

= 2.13.1 =
* Fixed PHP-path database export leaking persisted wpdb placeholder-escape hashes (cross-session `{HASH}` tokens). `build_values_string()` previously called `$wpdb->remove_placeholder_escape()`, which only matches the *current* request's session hash via `str_replace` — tokens minted by prior WordPress sessions fell through verbatim into the dump. The PHP-path row writer now uses the regex-based `Mighty_Backup_Placeholder_Repair::sanitize_string()` already used by the mysqldump streaming path, which matches `\{[a-f0-9]{64}\}` uniformly and also recomputes `s:N:"…"` length prefixes for serialized payloads (ACF flexible content, etc.). Net effect on poisoned databases: backup files come out clean even when the source DB still has tokens.
* Changed: the `placeholder_strips` counter (surfaced in the live-log warning) now also counts persisted-hash strips. Existing operators will see step-function increases the first time a 2.13.1 export runs over a corrupted DB — this is the new baseline, not a regression. The accompanying log message has been updated to reflect that the backup is clean and to recommend `wp mighty-backup repair placeholders --dry-run` only for cleaning the source DB.
* Added: per-row filter dispatch is now cached once per export run so the `mighty_backup_sanitize_placeholder_hashes` filter still works as a kill switch without paying `apply_filters` overhead on every column value.

= 2.13.0 =
* Added mid-table resumable PHP database export — `export_table_data_pk()` now time-checks between SQL batches and persists `{current_table, current_table_pk, current_table_last_pk}` in `db_export` state so a single large table can be sliced across multiple Action Scheduler chunks; survives any reasonable `max_execution_time` cap (the load-bearing fix for 9 GB single-table sites on hosts like Kinsta)
* Added range-chunked mysqldump path — tables exceeding `db_large_table_threshold_mb` (default 1 GB) are dumped as a sequence of `mysqldump --where='pk > A AND pk <= B'` invocations sized adaptively from the previous range's wall-time; small tables continue to flow through a single mysqldump invocation, and streamlined mode automatically falls back to the chunked PHP path so order/log filtering still applies
* Added pre-flight per-table size snapshot — one `information_schema` query at the start of a chunked export populates the live log with `Table wp_postmeta: 9.0 GB` per table-start, making "stuck on big table" obvious in the UI
* Added Advanced settings disclosure in the Schedule tab — `Chunk Seconds` (10–300, default 30) and `Large-Table Threshold` (128–10240 MB, default 1024) exposed via the existing form; the long-standing `mighty_backup_db_chunk_seconds` filter still wins over the option for `wp-config.php` overrides
* Added error-translator remediation hints for `Maximum execution time of N seconds exceeded` and "table has no primary key" — both deep-link into Settings → Schedule with concrete next steps (raise Chunk Seconds, mark structure-only, or add a PK)
* Fixed `get_large_tables()` skipping structure-only tables — a 9 GB log table marked structure-only would previously have been range-dumped, producing duplicate `CREATE TABLE` statements and exporting the data the user explicitly suppressed
* Fixed CLI `coerce_value` honoring the new `max` field in `KEY_META` — `wp mighty-backup settings set db_chunk_seconds 9999` is now rejected with a clear out-of-range message, matching the web UI clamp
* Fixed `finalize_mysqldump_chunked()` no longer appending the PHP-path postamble (`SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=1; COMMIT;`) when the placeholder-sanitization filter is disabled — mysqldump's own state-restore block stays authoritative

= 2.12.0 =
* Added onboarding wizard (`admin/views/onboarding-wizard.php`) — five-step chip flow covering Storage Credentials, GitHub Integration, Backup Schedule, Codespace Settings, and Notifications, so new installs see a guided setup instead of an empty settings page
* Added error translator (`includes/class-error-translator.php`) — maps raw exception messages and AWS error codes to human-readable explanations with remediation hints and deep-links into the relevant settings tab, surfaced across the live log, backup history, and AJAX response banners
* Added backup history logger (`includes/class-logger.php`) — custom database table records every backup with type, trigger source, status, timing, file sizes, remote object keys, and error messages for audit/troubleshooting
* Added per-table database export controls — settings page lets you exclude specific tables outright or export them structure-only (schema, no rows); new tables are included by default unless explicitly opted out
* Added tar archive post-verification — file archiver walks the tar.gz end-to-end after creation (shell `tar -tzf` when available, streaming PHP gzip+tar header parser as fallback) to catch archive desync before upload to Spaces
* Fixed database exporter respecting per-table overrides — exclusions and structure-only flags now propagate through the chunked export path, with skipped tables removed from progress counts so the bar no longer overshoots

= 2.10.0 =
* Added independent daily retention cron (`mighty_backup_retention`) — decouples cleanup from backup success so a streak of failed nightly backups can no longer let old objects accumulate on Spaces; the in-chain `step_cleanup` is preserved as the optimal "right after a fresh backup" prune
* Added "Retention last ran" diagnostic line on the Schedule tab — shows when retention last fired and how many database/file backups were removed (or the error message if it failed)
* Added "Last synced" status under the "Push as Codespaces Secret" button — persists owner/repo/timestamp from the most recent successful push (manual or auto) and renders via `human_time_diff()`; updates immediately on successful push without a page reload
* Added 32-core / 256 GB GitHub Codespaces tier to the devcontainer sizing logic — sites with raw size between 107 GB and 213 GB now correctly map to 32-core instead of falling back to a 16-core warning; size warning threshold raised accordingly
* Fixed `calculate_site_disk_size()` silently returning 0 (and thus selecting the smallest 4-core tier) when the iterator hit any unreadable subdirectory — the recursive walker now uses `CATCH_GET_CHILD` to skip unreadable subtrees, per-entry stat errors are caught individually, and root-inaccessibility surfaces as a `RuntimeException` instead of a phantom 0
* Fixed `cpus_to_disk_gb()` mapping for 2-core (now correctly reports 32 GB instead of 16 GB) and added explicit 32-core (256 GB) arm — only affects PR-body disk-size hints, but no longer misleads
* Removed the show/reveal toggle from the GitHub PAT field — the token now stays masked at all times (DO Spaces Access Key and Secret Key fields keep their toggles)

= 2.9.0 =
* Fixed `wpdb::placeholder_escape()` corruption at the source — the PHP database export path now strips `{<64-hex>}` placeholder tokens from every row before writing, so backups created from sites with `%` characters in user data no longer bake the session hash into the dump
* Added serialize-aware sanitize pass to the mysqldump and streamlined-hybrid export paths — strips persisted `{HASH}` tokens from the dump on the way out, recomputing `s:N:"…"` length prefixes; gated by the new `mighty_backup_sanitize_placeholder_hashes` filter (default true) so debugging admins can capture an unmodified dump
* Added `wp mighty-backup repair placeholders [--dry-run] [--no-backup-first]` — scans `options`, `posts`, and core `*meta` tables for persisted placeholder tokens, takes a pre-flight backup, repairs in place via raw `UPDATE` (bypassing `update_option()` so `%` is not re-escaped), and flushes object/page caches (LiteSpeed, WP Rocket, W3TC, plus the new `mighty_backup_after_repair_flush` action)
* Added authed `GET /wp-json/mighty-backup/v1/healthcheck` REST endpoint — Bearer-token authenticated like `/codespace-config`, exposes a `placeholder_hash_corruption` summary (count + sample location) so monitoring and the codespace bootstrap can detect persisted hashes BEFORE they end up in a backup
* Added automatic push of `BM_BOOTSTRAP_KEY` to the configured GitHub repo as a Codespaces secret — fires when a new API key is generated or when GitHub owner/repo/PAT change in the Devcontainer tab; silent best-effort, errors logged to the live backup log without blocking the originating action
* Fixed devcontainer hostRequirements update overwriting sibling fields — `cpus` is now patched in place, preserving any `memory`/`storage` keys that the template declares

= 2.8.0 =
* Added `wp mighty-backup api-key push-secret` — pushes `BM_BOOTSTRAP_KEY` to the configured GitHub repo as an encrypted Codespaces or Actions secret using libsodium sealed-box encryption against the repo's public key

= 2.7.1 =
* Fixed tar exit code 1 ("file changed as we read it") being treated as fatal failure during file archival — exit 1 is a non-fatal warning expected on live sites with active caches, sessions, and logs; only exit code 2+ is now treated as failure

= 2.7.0 =
* Fixed mysqldump false-failure on MariaDB hosts — the MariaDB `mysqldump` shim prints a deprecation warning to stderr on every call; the plugin no longer treats non-empty stderr as failure (gates on exit code only)
* Added `mariadb-dump` binary detection — prefers `mariadb-dump` over `mysqldump` when available, avoiding the deprecation warning entirely and forward-compatible with MariaDB dropping the mysqldump shim
* Added `set -o pipefail` to the mysqldump-to-gzip pipe so dump failures propagate correctly through the pipe

= 2.6.0 =
* Fixed DigitalOcean Spaces secret key not saving on initial save (double-sanitization bug when option did not yet exist) — same fix applied to the GitHub PAT
* Added target-branch selector for devcontainer update PRs — branches are fetched from GitHub during version check and presented as a dropdown (defaulting to the repo's default branch)
* Added `wp mighty-backup settings list|get|set` WP-CLI commands for managing all plugin settings from the command line, with transparent encryption of the DO Spaces secret and GitHub PAT and masked output unless `--show-secret(s)` is passed
* Added `wp mighty-backup api-key generate|show|delete` WP-CLI commands for managing the Codespace bootstrap API key (`bm_backup_api_key`) from the command line
* Added `wp mighty-backup devcontainer check|update` WP-CLI commands for checking the .devcontainer version and creating update PRs (with `--branch` targeting and `--yes` for unattended runs)

= 2.5.0 =
* Fixed backups hanging at "waiting for background processing" in both admin UI and WP-CLI
* Backup actions are now processed directly during status polling, removing dependency on WP-Cron and Action Scheduler's async dispatcher
* Prevents stale Action Scheduler claims from blocking backup execution

= 2.4.0 =
* Chunked database export — PHP-based DB exports now split across multiple Action Scheduler actions for reliable large database backups
* Time-bounded chunks (default 30 seconds per action, filterable via `mighty_backup_db_chunk_seconds`)
* Sub-progress reporting during DB export (shows table count and smooth progress bar interpolation)
* Fixed GitHub update checker URL — plugin updates now work correctly
* Stored update checker instance and set branch to `main` for correct fallback behavior
* Fixed admin UI step indicator pills not highlighting during backup (was referencing wrong property)
* Devcontainer size check now runs automatically during version check — detects when site has outgrown its Codespace tier
* Devcontainer resize creates a targeted PR updating only `hostRequirements.cpus` when version is current but machine is too small
* Codespace tier selection now includes 20% disk headroom
* Devcontainer hostRequirements now sets only `cpus` (storage is implicit with core count on GitHub Codespaces)

= 2.3.0 =

* Excluded production drop-in files from file backups (object-cache.php, advanced-cache.php)

= 1.15.0 =
* Fixed Pressable backups missing plugins and themes — ABSPATH on Pressable points to shared WordPress core (/wordpress/core/X.Y.Z/) while wp-content lives at /srv/htdocs/wp-content; archiver now detects when WP_CONTENT_DIR is outside ABSPATH and archives both locations
* Initialized GitHub update checker — plugin now auto-updates from GitHub releases
